## Problem
Detect complex activities. complex activity is a collection of temporally related atomic activities

## Useful
the most popular modeling
paradigm might be that of the graphical models, which include
techniques such as **hidden Markov models**, **Bayesian
networks**, and **conditional random fields** (Bui et al. 2008;
Hospedales et al. 2011; Liu et al. 2015).

## Comment
这篇paper主要是用了sensor data， 设计了一个graph model to model temporal interval dependency。
