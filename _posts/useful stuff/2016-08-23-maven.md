Recently I try to build several projects with maven and find it amazingly useful!

```
mvn compile
```

compile the projects and you will find .class files in target/class directory


```
mvn package
```

Compile the code, run all tests, package the code into jar file.

```
mvn install
```

install the dependencies to local machine for quick access.

compile, test, and package your projectâ€™s code and then copy it into the local dependency repository

Here is an maven life cycle figure from [this blog](https://premaseem.wordpress.com/2012/04/25/maven-2-lifecycle-phases/)
