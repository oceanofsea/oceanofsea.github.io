最近看了一些关于这方面的资料，觉得还是蛮感兴趣的。

# Prerequisite

## Math

主要是微积分求导，Differentiation is to get the rate of change of one variable respect to another variable.
```dx/dt```, for example, the speed is the rate of change of position respect to time.

从物理的角度来看， 是图上某一点的slope。

## Partial Derivative
If ```a``` directly affects ```c```, then we want to know how it affects ```c```. 
If ```a``` changes a little bit, how does ```c``` change? 
We call this the partial derivative of ```c``` with respect to ```a```.
