- Try to teach your child to focus and play with one item at a time.

- When evaluating an item, ask yourself what the item’s purpose is in your life. Does it bring you any satisfaction? Do you plan to use this item in the future You then have three options you can choose from: keep it, donate it, or throw it away.
