## log4j

Spark loads its default log4j properties, and some information is hidden.

To change this, you can define your own [log4j.properties](https://gist.github.com/SeaOfOcean/d7e7e43411801114072f4e7edbc3c8d1)

And the "standard placement" for this is 

```
src/main/resources
src/test/resources
```

The folder structure is as follows:

Now it works!
